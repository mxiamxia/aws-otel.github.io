OpenTelemetry aims to develop an open standard and provides implementation in multiple programming languages for collecting telemetry data, including metrics, tracing, and logs. The interns contributed the C++ Prometheus Exporter to the OpenTelemetry project. This exporter takes collected metrics from OpenTelemetry and exports to Prometheus, a popular open source alerting and monitoring application. This post explains how the Prometheus exporter works with the previously introduced metrics pipeline, potential code uses, and lessons learned along the way."},{"title":"AWS adds observability metrics to the OpenTelemetry C++ library","author":"Alolita Sharma","date":"01-Sep-2020","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-adds-observability-metrics-to-the-opentelemetry-c-library/","body":"In this post, three AWS interns—Brandon Kimberly, Ankit Bhargava, and Hudson Humphries—describe their first engineering contributions to the popular open source observability project OpenTelemetry."}]}}]}}}
